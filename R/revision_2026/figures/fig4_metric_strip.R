# Compact quantitative strip for Figure 4.
# Use with the network panels (fig4_network_trio.R, expanded 2026-08-27
# from 3 to 4 networks):
#   A true network | B baseline (fixed P) estimate | C symptom-only
#   estimate | D context-adjusted estimate
#   E estimated total coupling: sum_{i<j} omega_hat_ij
#   F spurious absolute coupling on symptom pairs with true omega_ij = 0
#
# Replaces fig4_summary_panels.R as the quantitative half of Figure 4.
# That earlier version tried to do three jobs (design schematic + summary
# stats + replicate-level robustness check) in one figure, which is why it
# read as sparse/unfocused however the individual panels were polished.
# This version keeps only what belongs in the main text:
#   - the design-schematic panel (old panel A) moves to the caption/Methods
#   - the paired-replicate jitter plot (old panel D) moves to supplement
#     as a robustness check, not main-figure content
#   - the remaining "excess global strength over true" panel replaces the
#     old absolute-scale panel B, which was forced to a huge y-range by
#     including the "true" reference as a separate value on the same axis
#     rather than differencing against it directly
#
# Meant to sit alongside fig4_network_trio.R's output as Figure 4's full
# panel set (network trio on top, this strip on the bottom), assembled in
# LaTeX/Overleaf rather than composited in R -- qgraph's base-R graphics
# and this file's ggplot objects don't combine directly via patchwork
# without extra wiring (ggplotify::as.ggplot() / wrap_elements()), left
# as deferred, lower-priority work.

# This strip is placed at the SAME LaTeX width as the network trio
# (\textwidth, not 0.82\textwidth as before), so panels E/F print larger
# and their error bars are easier to read. With both figures now sharing
# the same width-based scale factor (~6.5/9.2 ~= 0.71, using the trio's
# current 9.2in native width as reference), the earlier 13.3pt title
# override (calibrated for the narrower 0.67x placement) would now
# overshoot and print larger than the trio's titles, so sizes below are
# recalibrated for the new scale factor. Canvas native size bumped
# slightly (8.0x2.6 -> 8.4x2.75) so once both figures share the print
# width, this strip's height comes out close to but slightly less than
# the trio's.

# Panel E: estimated total coupling (signed sum of estimated pairwise
# couplings), with a dashed reference line at the data-generating value
# (true_total_coupling=3.05). Using the signed sum rather than an
# absolute-value global-strength statistic avoids the systematic upward
# contribution that comes from summing |estimate| over true-zero edges,
# where sampling noise is symmetric around zero but abs() makes all of it
# positive.
#
# y-axis limits/breaks (both panels) are FIXED per the design-pass spec
# rather than computed from summary_by_arm, to remove dead space above/
# below the points. If a future data refresh shifts coupling_mean/
# spurious_mean meaningfully, check the rendered PNG for clipped points/
# error bars before trusting these fixed ranges again.
